# Not Tetris Not Twitch (NTNT)
A full stack web application that allows users to play single player or 2 player Tetris.  The 2 player forum also has real-time chat that any number of spectators can use.  The server is express while the authentication is implemented with passport.  The passwords are salted and hashed with bcrypt.  The front end uses a combination of plain Javascript with jQuery and React with classes.
